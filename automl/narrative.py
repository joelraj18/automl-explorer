"""Beginner-friendly explanations.

Every decision the engine makes is recorded as a ``Step``:

* found  - the evidence we saw in the data (with real numbers / column names)
* why    - why that evidence matters, in plain English
* action - what we do about it, phrased as "We ..., so that ..."
* code   - (notebook cells) what the code does, in plain words

The engine's decisions use ``TEMPLATES`` below; each notebook cell's story lives in
``codegen.py`` next to the code it explains. After a cell runs, its code writes
"what we found" itself with ``note()``.
